# OBC-multiple-equilibria
This repository provides documents and codes for simulating multiple equilibria in otherwise-linear rational expectations with occasionally-binding constraints, under the assumption of perfect foresight. The algorithm is an extension of Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015,JME) and we utilise some results from Holden (2022,ReStat).
